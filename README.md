# Objective
Using the terminal intiate an application in which the user can keep track of the employees within database. This application is based off the University of Michigan current and former players. 

# Description
This application allows the user to interact with information stored in a database. In the case of this application, the user will be able to manage a company's employee database by looking at the departments, at the employees, the roles employees have, and their managers.

# Installation
In order for this application to work, the user needs to initialize the application by first typing "npm i" to download all the needed packages. 2nd, the user will then type "node server.js" in the terminal to start the application. 3rd, the user will be given a prompt that will ask what they want to look at, and be given various options. Options include view: all departments, all employees, all roles, all managers.

# Usage and Future Improvements
This application can be used to view content a user has in a database. In the case of this particular application, the user can look at the different employees, roles, managers, and departments that exist in the database.

As mentioned in the video, I was not able to fully complete this challenge. I had various issues using mysql workbench and creating a new database. I believe the possible error I have in this project is that I did not properly seed my data into mysql workbench. However, I look forward to reading the comments and suggestions from the grader. I want to better improve this application and get one step closer to completeing it.
